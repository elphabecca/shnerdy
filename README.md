# Shnerdy

Shnerdy is a tool for more efficiently finding (generally nerdy) t-shirts. This web-app saves the search terms for a user and then searches the Etsy API for all terms at once, quickly returning multiple and varied search results to the user with an image, price, and link to access the shirt for purchase. The user is able to rate shirts and visit a page of their favorites. Sign-in is done exclusively via OAuth.
